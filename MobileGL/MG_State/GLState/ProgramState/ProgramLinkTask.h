    // PHASE A of one glLinkProgram: the half that decides what GL can be asked about the
    // program - glslang link + mapIO, the GL-facing reflection surface, fragment-output
    // validation and transform-feedback resolution - with every input it needs snapshotted at
    // enqueue.
    //
    // Every one of the eight ways a link can fail lives here, so once this node has published
    // through EnsureLinkJoined() the program's LINK_STATUS, info log and entire query surface
    // are FINAL and truthful. SPIR-V generation, spirv-opt and the global-UBO routing tables
    // moved to ProgramSpirvTask, which chains behind this node and is joined by only five
    // getters (see ProgramObject::EnsureSpirvJoined).
    //
    // Same ownership rule as ShaderCompileTask: the body reads nothing but `in` (all of it
    // owned or immutable) and writes nothing but `artifacts`. No GL call, no
    // pActiveBackendObject read, no pGLContext->RecordError(); the device limits arrive
    // through the CompileEnv snapshot and diagnostics are deferred to the join.
    //
    // ONE LINK IS ONE HANDLER. RunBody() runs start to finish inside a single pool handler
    // and is the only place `artifacts` is written. Splitting it across handlers to
    // "pipeline" the reflection half would let a cancel land between the halves and publish a
    // program whose SPIR-V and reflection describe different things - so any such split has
    // to be structural: the first half must publish a LINK_STATUS and a query surface that
    // are already final, and a lost second half must degrade to "linked but not drawable",
    // never to a half-published program. (The intermediates' ordering constraint that used to
    // be quoted here is retested and no longer binding; see the ordering note in RunBody.)
